      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>A huge part of success in entertainment is advertising, and yet game websites are primarily used to link to socials. Imagine a game website that contained loads more helpful information to sell you. That is what the website for my game "Slay the Spider" intends to do.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our audience is PC gamers who love strategic games. Gamers who played the XCOM series, Slay the Spire, or Fire Emblem are the perfect audience. Because of the popularity of strategy games with older demographics, we are primarily marketing towards generation X.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        <p>The spider awakens.</p>

        <p>Play as the veteran Edric Holmwoode as he burrows deep into the GREAT SPIDERS lair. Facing off against seemingly unstoppable odds, will you be able to regain Edric's honor and SLAY THE SPIDER?</p>

        <p>Slay the Spider is a simple to pickup, hard to master game, blending turn-based gameplay similar to XCOM and Fire Emblem with real time trap dodging and exploration. Solve difficult puzzles, defeat powerful foes, and aquire new and powerful gear.</p>

        <p>FEATURES:</p>

        <p>Tile Based combat: maneuvering carefully, use your abilities to defeat the enemies that beset you. Make sure to manage your Action Points well, or else you may be in for a rude suprise. With deep gameplay elements such as opportunity attacks and buffs, there are infinite combinations of strategies that await you.</p>


        <p>Real Time Gameplay: Outside of combat there are a multitude of things to do. Solve puzzles to earn new gear, dodge harrowing traps, or visit the local tavern and look for work. While you may master the turn based gameplay, you'll need to keep your reflexes sharp in Slay the Spider.</p>

        <p>Old School Done New: While the images may make you believe the graphics for this game are strictly "old-school," players will be delighted to find a hybrid of modern animation principles mixed into a retro style. The end result leaves a nostalgic taste that still feels brand new.</p>

        <p>Taking a look at the upcoming gear system</p>

        <p>When I first started working on this game, I originally planned to have abilities that the player would pick up and use in combat. However, as time went by I began to want more features, such as buying and selling abilities from shops. That felt a little weird (I'm selling my ability to slash?). This problem as well as a desire to create another layer of depth in the gameplay led me to create a gear system!</p>

        <p>How it works</p>

        <p>Now, instead of picking up an ability from a chest directly, you pick up gear. Each piece of gear has one ability associated with it, and if you equip the gear you can use it in combat. For example, a steel sword would have the slash ability. What is different now is gear can have effects, which can change the way the weapon works. As an example, the above steel sword could have a +3 damage effect, which makes the slash attack deal 3 more damage when used.</p> 
        
        <p>There is much more this system is capable of! Another example is a necklace that heals you for 10 health after each combat, handy! Or a breastplate that gives armor at the start of combat. this can create interesting choices for the player: "The ability on this gear isn't as good as other gear, but it has amazing effects! Which should I chose?"</p>

        <p>With all of this in mind I'm excited to see how players interact with the new gear system!</p>
